# Roblox Executor (Have not come up with the name yet) (Experimental)

### coming soon!

### Overview

This is an **experimental Roblox executor** that utilizes a newly discovered exploit to provide **privileged access** within the game. The exploit makes use of specific **FFlags** and **running processes**, granting admin-level permissions that allow advanced exploits such as **require scripts**, **server-sided (SS) scripts**, and more. The executor is designed to be fast, reliable, and compatible with both **desktop versions** of Roblox (website and app). 

A mobile version is in development, as the same exploit has been found to work on **Roblox mobile** as well.

### Features

- **Privileged Access:** Provides access equivalent to that of an admin, allowing for complete control and flexibility during gameplay.
- **Exploit Mechanics:** Utilizes a robust combination of **FFlags** and internal Roblox processes, bypassing modern game security measures like **Filtering Enabled (FE)**.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works seamlessly on both the **website** and **app** versions of Roblox on desktop, ensuring full functionality regardless of how Roblox is accessed.
- **Expansive Script Library:** Includes a wide array of pre-built scripts, including **require scripts**, **FE scripts**, and other advanced exploit scripts that are ready to use. The library is continually expanding, allowing users to access the latest exploits with ease.
- **Speedy Execution:** The executor offers **blazing fast execution speeds**, especially for large and complex scripts. Users experience minimal lag, even when running resource-heavy scripts.
- **Undetectable:** Designed to minimize detection, the executor operates stealthily within the Roblox environment, significantly reducing the risk of bans or other consequences.
- **Advanced SaveInstance:** The built-in **SaveInstance** feature allows users to save **server scripts**, **local scripts**, **assets**, and other critical game data with remarkable speed and precision. This tool is optimized to handle complex data extraction with high accuracy.
- **Stylish and Intuitive UI:** The executor includes a user-friendly and visually appealing interface, making it easy to navigate and execute scripts efficiently.
- **Tested Against Leading Executors:** Yes,  we did test against other executors despite very early stages of development. This executor has been throughly tested against other popular executors such as **Solara**, **Celery**, **Byte Breaker**, and more. It has consistently outperformed them in terms of speed, undetectability, script execution reliability, and overall performance, thanks to the recently discovered exploit.
- **Supports Both FE & SS Scripts:** Execute **Filtering Enabled** and **Server-Sided** scripts with full bypasses of Roblox’s security layers, allowing you to achieve scripting capabilities that would typically require far more complex tools, and is very easy, almost as if you were in a time before fe and hyperion and all that, even I sometimes forget we are in a period where there is fe and hyperion when using this.

### Why This Executor Stands Out

- **Superior Script Library:** Unlike most executors, this tool offers an expansive, **curated script library**, ensuring you have access to the latest **FE** and **require scripts**. Scripts that normally wouldn’t run on regular executors can be executed easily.
- **Unparalleled Speed:** Whether you're running small scripts or large, complex exploits, the executor handles it all **with unmatched speed**. It processes scripts faster than competitors, including **Solara** and **Celery**, making it one of the fastest executors available.
- **Cross-Platform Functionality:** Works on both **website** and **app** versions of Roblox, providing maximum versatility for users who prefer different platforms.
- **Undetectable Execution:** By utilizing advanced exploit techniques, the executor is highly undetectable compared to other tools, offering more security and peace of mind.
- **Comprehensive SaveInstance:** The SaveInstance feature allows you to save **entire game states** quickly and with high accuracy, including server scripts and complex assets—far superior to other executors' SaveInstance tools, which often struggle with speed or completeness.

### What’s Coming Next

- **Mobile Version in Development:** A mobile version of this executor is on the way! The same exploit was found to work on **Roblox mobile**, and development has already begun. Expect similar features, including script execution and SaveInstance, to work on **mobile devices** soon.

### Disclaimer
**This is an experimental tool and should be used with caution.** Misuse of exploits may result in account bans or other consequences. Always be aware of the risks involved when using exploits in Roblox.

### How to Use

1. **Download** the executor from the [releases section](#). ***(NOT RELEASED YET)***
2. Launch the executor and follow the instructions provided to attach it to your Roblox process (works on both the **website** and **app versions**).
3. Use supported scripts from the **expansive script library** or your own custom scripts to leverage the full potential of the executor.

### Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of Roblox executors and scripting.
- **Administrator access** on your local machine is required to run the executor properly.

### Roadmap

- [ ] Improve stability and support for more Roblox game scripts.
- [ ] Further enhance UI/UX for an even smoother user experience.
- [ ] Continue testing and improving **anti-detection** capabilities.
- [ ] Expand the **SaveInstance** functionality to cover more complex game data, scripts and structures.
- [ ] Release a **mobile version** of the executor.
