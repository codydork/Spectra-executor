# Apex Roblox Executor (Experimental, in very early beta)

### Coming soon! (Made entirely by me)

### Overview

**Apex** is an **experimental Roblox executor** that uses a newly discovered exploit to provide **privileged access** within the game. By utilising specific **FFlags** and **processes**, Apex grants admin-level permissions, allowing for advanced exploits such as **require scripts**, **server-sided (SS) scripts**, and more. Apex is designed for **speed**, **reliability**, and **cross-platform compatibility**, working on both the **website** and **app versions** of Roblox on desktop.

A **mobile version** is also in development, as the same exploit has been confirmed to work on **Roblox mobile**.

### Pricing

**Apex is a paid executor**. It is available for **£10 per month**, giving you access to its full range of features, including **fast execution**, **SaveInstance** capabilities, and the **expansive script library**.

### Features

- **Privileged Access:** Apex provides access equivalent to that of an admin, allowing full control and flexibility during gameplay.
- **Exploit Mechanics:** Utilizes a powerful combination of **FFlags** and internal Roblox processes to bypass modern security features like **Filtering Enabled (FE)** and **Hyperion**.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Apex works seamlessly on both the **website** and **app** versions of Roblox, ensuring full functionality regardless of how Roblox is accessed.
- **Expansive Script Library:** Apex comes with a **large, curated library of pre-built scripts**, including **require scripts**, **FE scripts**, and other advanced exploits. This library is continuously expanding, giving you access to the latest and most powerful scripts.
- **Speedy Execution:** Apex delivers **blazing fast script execution**, especially for large or complex scripts. It processes scripts quickly, ensuring smooth performance without lag, even when running resource-heavy exploits.
- **Undetectable:** Designed to minimize detection, Apex operates stealthily within Roblox, significantly reducing the risk of account bans or other penalties.
- **Advanced SaveInstance:** The built-in **SaveInstance** feature allows you to save **server scripts**, **local scripts**, **assets**, and other critical game data with high speed and accuracy. Apex’s SaveInstance is far superior to competitors, ensuring reliable extraction of game data.
- **Stylish and Intuitive UI:** Apex features a clean, user-friendly interface that makes it easy to navigate and execute scripts, even for beginners.
- **Tested Against Leading Executors:** Apex has been tested against other leading executors like **Solara**, **Celery**, **Byte Breaker**, and more. It has consistently outperformed them in terms of speed, undetectability, script execution reliability, and overall performance.
- **Supports Both FE & SS Scripts:** Apex allows you to execute **Filtering Enabled** and **Server-Sided** scripts with full bypasses of Roblox’s security layers. It brings back the freedom of pre-Hyperion and pre-FE environments, making script execution easy and unrestricted.

### Why Apex Stands Out

- **Superior Script Library:** Apex offers an **expansive and curated library** of the latest scripts, including **FE** and **require scripts** that normally wouldn’t run on other executors.
- **Unmatched Speed:** Apex processes scripts **faster** than other executors, including **Solara**, **Celery**, and **Byte Breaker**, making it one of the most efficient tools on the market.
- **Cross-Platform Functionality:** Apex works seamlessly on both the **website** and **app** versions of Roblox on desktop, giving users the flexibility to choose their preferred platform.
- **Undetectable Execution:** Apex is engineered for stealth, ensuring your scripts run undetected by Roblox’s anti-cheat systems.
- **Comprehensive SaveInstance:** The **SaveInstance** feature allows you to save **entire game states** quickly and accurately, far surpassing other executors in terms of speed and completeness. You can extract complex game data, including server scripts, assets, and more, with minimal effort.

### Coming Soon

- **Mobile Version in Development:** A mobile version of Apex is in the works! The same exploit found on desktop versions of Roblox is confirmed to work on **Roblox mobile**, and development is already underway. Expect the same powerful features, including script execution and SaveInstance, to be available on **mobile devices** soon.
