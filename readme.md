### 🚀 Coming soon! (Made entirely by me, codydork, a team is coming soon) watch 👀 or star ⭐ this repo to keep up with whats happening.

NOTES: feel free to decompile this upon release to ensure its not a RAT, as i am fine with people looking at how the exploit works, but you CANNOT SKID the code, or the exploit either, which cannot be decompiled from the exe, incase you try to skid it.

### Overview

**Apex** is an **experimental Roblox executor** that uses a newly discovered exploit to provide **privileged access** within the game. By utilising specific **FFlags** and manipulating and utilising **running code within the game**, Apex grants admin-level permissions, allowing for advanced exploits such as **require scripts**, **server-sided (SS) scripts**, and more. Apex is designed for **speed**, **reliability**, and **cross-platform compatibility**, working on both the **website** and **app versions** of Roblox on desktop.

📱 A **mobile version** is in development, as the same exploit has been confirmed to work on **Roblox mobile**.

---

### 💸 Pricing

**Apex is a paid executor**, available for **£10 per month** for now. Your subscription grants you full access to all features, including fast execution, SaveInstance, and the expanding script library.

---

### 🌟 Features

- **👑 Privileged Access:** Apex provides admin-level access, boasting around level 9 or above approx, as if you were the owner of the game, or like the root user on linux, offering complete control and flexibility in gameplay, and bypassing fe and hyperion with ease as if you were in a post hyperion and fe enviroment, sometimes I even forget I am in an era with hyperion and fe when using this executor
- **⚙️ Exploit Mechanics:** A powerful combination of certain **FFlags**, exploiting them, then manipulating running code within the game allows Apex to bypass **Filtering Enabled (FE)** and **Hyperion** restrictions.
- **🖥️ Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works on both the **website** and **app** versions of Roblox on desktop for seamless functionality.
- **📜 Expansive Script Library:** Apex includes a **growing collection of scripts** like **require scripts**, **FE scripts**, and more. This library is continuously updated with the latest and most powerful scripts.
- **🚀 Speedy Execution:** Apex delivers **blazing-fast execution** speeds for even the most complex scripts, ensuring smooth gameplay without lag.
- **🛡️ Undetectable:** Apex operates stealthily within Roblox, significantly reducing the risk of detection and account bans.
- **💾 Advanced SaveInstance:** Due to the fact that you have admin-like privileges, you can access server sided scripts and other things you normally wouldnt be able to saveinstance. the **SaveInstance** feature allows users to save **server scripts**, **local scripts**, and other assets with impressive speed and precision. It's optimized for accuracy and is faster than other executors.
- **🎨 Stylish UI:** Apex includes a **clean, intuitive interface**, making it easy to use for beginners and advanced users alike.
- **⚖️ Tested Against Competitors:** Despite its early stages of development, Apex has been rigorously tested against leading executors like **Solara**, **Celery**, and **Byte Breaker**, outperforming them in speed, reliability, and script execution, maybe not unc, but we are working on the unc.

### **Legend**
- **✅ Advanced (🟢)**: Fully developed and highly effective for professional use.
- **🟡 Intermediate**: Functional with some limitations or reduced flexibility.
- **⚠️ Basic (🔴)**: Entry-level, functional but lacks advanced features.
- **❌ None**: Feature not available or implemented.
- **🎨 Polished**: Indicates a refined and user-friendly design.

---

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Apex** excels (kinda) in **Universal Script Compatibility (UNC)**, meaning it supports a wide range of scripts, including complex ones that other executors struggle to handle.
- **Solara** offers moderate compatibility and cross-platform support but lacks advanced execution features.
- **Celery** and **Byte Breaker** have limited script compatibility and basic features, making them more suitable for lightweight or beginner tasks.

---

- **🗂️ Superior Script Library:** Access a curated, up-to-date library with **require** scripts that normally wouldn't run on other executors.
- **⚡ Unmatched Speed:** Whether you're running small or large scripts, Apex processes them **faster** than competitors, like **Solara** and **Celery**, making it one of the fastest executors available.
- **🌐 Cross-Platform Functionality:** Works smoothly on both **website** and **app** versions of Roblox for desktop.
- **🕵️‍♂️ Undetectable Execution:** Designed for stealth, Apex is engineered to avoid detection by Roblox’s anti-cheat systems, keeping your account safer.
- **💾 Superior SaveInstance:** Save entire game states quickly and accurately, including **server scripts** and assets—offering far more speed and reliability than other executors.

---

### 📱 What’s Coming Next

- **Mobile Version in Development:** A **mobile version** of Apex is on the way! The same exploit found on desktop versions of Roblox is confirmed to work on **Roblox mobile**, and development has already begun. Expect similar powerful features, including script execution and post-fe and ss script execution, including require, on **mobile devices** soon.

---

### ⚠️ Disclaimer

**This is an experimental tool and should be used with caution.** Misuse of exploits may result in account bans or other penalties. Always be aware of the risks involved when using exploits in Roblox.

---

### 💻 How to Use

1. **Download** the executor from the [releases section](#). ***(NOT RELEASED YET)***
2. Launch Apex and follow the provided instructions to attach it to your Roblox process (supports both the **website** and **app versions**).
3. Use scripts from the **expansive script library** or your own custom scripts to unlock the full potential of the executor.

---

### ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Roblox executors and scripting.
- **Administrator access** on your machine is required to run the executor.

---

### 🛠️ Roadmap

- [ ] Improve stability and add support for more Roblox game scripts.
- [ ] Further enhance the **UI/UX** for an even smoother experience.
- [ ] Continue testing and improving **anti-detection** capabilities.
- [ ] Expand the **SaveInstance** feature to handle even more complex data and assets.
- [ ] Release a **mobile version** of the executor soon!
- [ ] Inprove UNC
- [ ] Make an AI that when prompt is typed in creates and executes that script eg if u say "create a aimbot script" it will create and execute one, can do the same with ss scripts, and then implement more ai features into the executor
