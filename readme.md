# Roblox Executor (Have not come up with the name yet) (Experimental)

### Overview

This is an **experimental Roblox executor** that utiliises a newly discovered exploit to provide privileged access within the game. The exploit makes use of specific **FFlags** and **running processes** to grant the user admin-level permissions, enabling advanced scripting capabilities.

### Features

- **Privileged Access:** The executor provides access equivalent to an admin account, allowing for more control and flexibility during gameplay.
- **Exploit Mechanics:** Utilizes a unique combination of FFlags and internal processes within the Roblox environment.
- **Script Execution:** Supports **FE (Filtering Enabled)**, **SS (Server-Sided)**, and other script types, allowing you to run scripts as if in a **post-Hyperion** and **post-FE** environment.

### What this means:
- You can run scripts with extended privileges, typically reserved for admin users.
- Execute both client-side and server-side scripts effectively.
- Bypass certain in-game restrictions related to Roblox's security layers (Filtering Enabled).

### Disclaimer
**This is an experimental tool and should be used with caution.** Misuse of exploits may result in account bans or other consequences. Always ensure you're aware of the risks involved when using exploits in Roblox.
