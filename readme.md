# Roblox Executor (Have not come up with the name yet) (Experimental)

### Overview

This is a beta, **experimental Roblox executor** that utilizes a newly discovered exploit to provide **privileged access** within the game. The exploit takes advantage of specific **FFlags** and **running processes** to grant admin-level permissions, enabling advanced exploits, such as running **require scripts** and server-sided scripts, that would typically require a server-side (SS) executor. It offers unparalleled control and script execution speed.

### Features

- **Privileged Access:** Provides access equivalent to that of an admin, allowing for greater control and flexibility during gameplay.
- **Exploit Mechanics:** Utilizes a powerful combination of **FFlags** and internal Roblox processes, making it possible to bypass in-game security.
- **Script Execution:** Supports both **FE (Filtering Enabled)** and **SS (Server-Sided)** scripts, enabling you to run scripts as though Roblox’s modern security layers do not exist, similar to a **post-Hyperion** and **post-FE** environment.
- **Fast Execution:** The exploit offers **exceptional execution speed**, even for large, complex scripts, allowing for smoother gameplay and faster processing times.
- **Undetectable:** The executor is designed to operate in a way that minimizes the chances of detection by Roblox’s anti-cheat systems, providing an extra layer of safety for users.
- **Stylish UI:** Features a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy to navigate and use, even for those new to executors.
- **Advanced SaveInstance:** Built-in **SaveInstance** functionality allows users to save entire game instances, including **server scripts**, **local scripts**, and other assets. This tool is highly optimized, offering **speed and accuracy** unmatched by most other SaveInstance tools.

### What this means:
- You can run scripts with **root-level** privileges, similar to having admin or game owner access.
- It can execute both client-side and server-side scripts effectively, bypassing **FE (Filtering Enabled)** restrictions.
- The **SaveInstance** tool is highly efficient, capable of quickly and accurately saving critical game data, such as server scripts, giving you full access to a game’s internal structures.
- This tool is likely to **revolutionize** how Roblox executors are built and used, thanks to its speed and capability.

### Disclaimer
**This is an experimental tool and should be used with caution.** Misuse of exploits may result in account bans or other consequences. Always be aware of the risks involved when using exploits in Roblox.
